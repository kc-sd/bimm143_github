## Using Git

git is a command line version control system. We can use it from RStudio (through the "git" panel/pane on the right) or alternatively from the command line (terminal). 

The steps to using git involve: 

- initiating a git repository
  `git init` or click box in rstudio
  
- do your work
  adding/editing/saving files, etc. 
  
- **add relevant files to the stage**
  git add your file name 
  or click the small unchecked box to add to the stage
  
- **commit your changes**
  git commit -m "message"
  click commit button in rstudio
