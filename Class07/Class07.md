## Background

Today we will begin our exploration of important machine learning
methods with a focus on **clustering** and **dimensionallity
reduction**.

To start testing these methods let’s make up some sample data to cluster
where we know what the answer should be.

``` r
hist(rnorm(3000, mean = 10))
```

> Q. Can you generate 30 numbers centered at +3 and 30 numbers at -3

``` r
tmp <- c(rnorm(30, mean = 3), 
         rnorm(30, mean = -3))

x <- cbind(x=tmp, y=rev(tmp))
plot(x)
```

## K-means clustering

The main function in “base R” for K-means clustering is called
`kmeans()`, let’s try it out:

``` r
k <- kmeans(x, centers = 2)
k
```

    K-means clustering with 2 clusters of sizes 30, 30

    Cluster means:
              x         y
    1 -3.058139  2.961751
    2  2.961751 -3.058139

    Clustering vector:
     [1] 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    [39] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

    Within cluster sum of squares by cluster:
    [1] 52.68442 52.68442
     (between_SS / total_SS =  91.2 %)

    Available components:

    [1] "cluster"      "centers"      "totss"        "withinss"     "tot.withinss"
    [6] "betweenss"    "size"         "iter"         "ifault"      

> Q. What component of your kmeans result object has the cluster
> centers?

``` r
k$centers
```

              x         y
    1 -3.058139  2.961751
    2  2.961751 -3.058139

> Q. What component of your kmeans result object has the cluster size

``` r
k$size
```

``` r

```

    [39] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

``` r
plot(x, col=k$cluster)
points(k$centers, col="blue", pch=15, ,cex=2)
```

``` r
j <- kmeans(x, centers = 4)
plot(x, col=j$cluster)
points(j$centers, col="blue", pch=15, cex=2)
```

> for (this is the “K” or “centers” in K-means)!

``` r
k$tot.withinss
```

## Hierarchical Clustering

The main function for Hierarchical clustering in base R is called
`hclust()`.

One of the main differences with respect to the `kmeans()` function is
that you cannot just pass your input data directly to `hclust()` - it
needs a “distance matrix” as input. We can get this from lot’s of places
including the `dist()` function.

``` r
d <- dist(x)
hc <- hclust(d)
plot(hc)
```

![](Class07_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png)

We can “cut” the dendrogram or “tree” at a given height to yield our
“clusters”. For this we use the function `cutree()`

``` r
plot(hc)
abline(h=10, col="red")
```

![](Class07_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png)

``` r
grps <- cutree(hc, h=10)
```

``` r
grps
```

     [1] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2
    [39] 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2

> Q. PLot our data `x` colored by the clusterinv result from `hclust()`

plot(x, col=grps)

## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

PCA is a popular dimensionality reduction technique that is widely used
in bioinformatics.

\##PCA of UK food data

Read data on food consumption in the UK

``` r
url <- "https://tinyurl.com/UK-foods"
x <- read.csv(url)
x
```

                         X England Wales Scotland N.Ireland
    1               Cheese     105   103      103        66
    2        Carcass_meat      245   227      242       267

    5       Fats_and_oils      193   235      184       209
    6               Sugars     156   175      147       139
    7      Fresh_potatoes      720   874      566      1033

    17      Confectionery       54    64       62        41

It looks like the row names are not set properly. We can fix this.

``` r
rownames(x) <-  x[,1]
x <- x[,-1]
x
```

                        England Wales Scotland N.Ireland
    Cheese                  105   103      103        66

    Other_meat              685   803      750       586
    Fish                    147   160      122        93
    Fats_and_oils           193   235      184       209
    Sugars                  156   175      147       139
    Fresh_potatoes          720   874      566      1033
    Fresh_Veg               253   265      171       143
    Other_Veg               488   570      418       355
    Processed_potatoes      198   203      220       187
    Processed_Veg           360   365      337       334
    Fresh_fruit            1102  1137      957       674
    Cereals                1472  1582     1462      1494
    Beverages                57    73       53        47
    Soft_drinks            1374  1256     1572      1506
    Alcoholic_drinks        375   475      458       135
    Confectionery            54    64       62        41

A better way to do this is fix the row names assignment at import time:

``` r
x <- read.csv(url, row.names = 1)
x
```

                        England Wales Scotland N.Ireland
    Cheese                  105   103      103        66
    Carcass_meat            245   227      242       267
    Other_meat              685   803      750       586
    Fish                    147   160      122        93
    Fats_and_oils           193   235      184       209

I prefer the method we used that fixed the row names assignment at
import time.

Changing `beside=T` to `beside=F`.

Changing `position = "dodge"` to `position = "stack"`.

pairs(x, col=rainbow(nrow(x)), pch=16)
```

![](Class07_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png)

``` r
library(pheatmap)

pheatmap( as.matrix(x) )
```

![](Class07_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png)

If a given point lies on the diagonal for a given plot, then the two
countries match in terms of consumption for a given product. The heatmap
shows higher consumption of a product with warmer colors, and lower
consumption with cooler colors.

For the most part, each country clusters together except for Northern
Ireland reflecting similar food consumption between Scotland, England,
and Wales. It’s a bit hard to tell, but they mainly differ on
consumption of fresh fruit, other meat, and fresh potatoes. It’s
definitely easier to see a mismatch on the pair plot rather than the
heatmap figures, but there is still an observable difference on the
heatmap.

### Heatmap

We can install the `pheatmap` package with the `install.packages()`
command that we used previously. Remember that we always run this in the
console and not a code chunk in our quarto document.

Of all these plot really only the `pairs()` plot was useful. This
however took a bit of work to interpret and will not scale when I am
looking at much bigger datasets.

## PCA the rescue

The main funciton in “base R” for PCA is called `prcomp()`.

``` r
pca <- prcomp(t(x))
summary(pca)
```

    Importance of components:
                                PC1      PC2      PC3       PC4
    Standard deviation     324.1502 212.7478 73.87622 3.176e-14
    Proportion of Variance   0.6744   0.2905  0.03503 0.000e+00
    Cumulative Proportion    0.6744   0.9650  1.00000 1.000e+00

> Q. How much variance is captured in the first PC?

67.4%

> Q. How many PCs do I need to capture at least 90% of the total
> variance in the dataset?

Two PCs capture 96.5% of the total variance.

> Q. Plot our main PCA result. Folks can call this different things
> depending on their field of study e.g. “PC plot”, “ordination plot”,
> “Score plot”, “PC1 vs PC2 plot”…

``` r
attributes(pca)
```

    $names
    [1] "sdev"     "rotation" "center"   "scale"    "x"       

    $class
    [1] "prcomp"

To generate our PCA score plot we want the `pca$x` component of the
result object

``` r
pca$x
```

                     PC1         PC2        PC3           PC4
    England   -144.99315   -2.532999 105.768945 -4.894696e-14

## Digging deeper (variable loadings)

How do the original variables (i.e. the 17 different foods) contribute
to our new PCs?

``` r
ggplot(pca$rotation) +
  aes(x = PC1, 
      y = reorder(rownames(pca$rotation), PC1)) +
  geom_col(fill = "steelblue") +
  xlab("PC1 Loading Score") +
  ylab("") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = 9))
```

![](Class07_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-27-1.png)

> Q9: Generate a similar ‘loadings plot’ for PC2. What two food groups
> feature prominantely and whoat does PC2 mainly tell us about?

``` r
ggplot(pca$rotation) +
  aes(x = PC2, 
      y = reorder(rownames(pca$rotation), PC2)) +
  geom_col(fill = "steelblue") +
  xlab("PC2 Loading Score") +
  ylab("") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = 9))
```

![](Class07_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-28-1.png)

The two food groups that are the most prominent are soft drinks and
alcoholic drinks. PC2 mainly provides information on the second highest
variance in the data, after PC1.
