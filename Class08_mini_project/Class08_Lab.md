## Background

In today’s class we will apply the methods and techniques clustering and
PCA to help make sense of a real world breast cancer FNA biopsy data
set.

``` r
fna.data <- "WisconsinCancer.csv"
wisc.df <- read.csv(fna.data, row.names=1)
```

``` r
wisc.data <- wisc.df[,-1]
#removes first column from dataset, we don't want to use this for machine learning models, instead will use it later to compare results to the expert diagnosis
```

``` r
diagnosis <- wisc.df$diagnosis
#stores diagnosis column from original dataset in variable "diagnosis"
```

> Q1: How many observations are in this dataset?

``` r
View(wisc.data)
```

There are 569 observations in this dataset.

> Q2: How many of the observations have a malignant diagnosis?

``` r
table(wisc.df$diagnosis)
```


      B   M 
    357 212 

``` r
sum(wisc.df$diagnosis == "M")
```

    [1] 212

``` r
table(wisc.df$diagnosis == "M")
```


    FALSE  TRUE 
      357   212 

There are 212 observations with a malignant diagnosis.

> Q3: How many variables/features in the data are suffixed with \_mean?

``` r
sum(grepl("_mean$", colnames(wisc.data)))
```

    [1] 10

``` r
#either works
length(grep("_mean", colnames(wisc.data)))
```

    [1] 10

There are 10 observations that are suffixed with “mean”.

## Principal Component Analysis

The main function here is `prcomp()` and we want to make sure we set the
optional argument `scale=TRUE`:

``` r
wisc.pr <- prcomp(wisc.data, scale = T)
summary(wisc.pr)
```

44.27% of the original variance is captured by PC1.

It takes 3 PCs to describe at least 70% of the original variance.

> Q6: How many principal components are required to describe at least
> 90% of the original variance in the data?

It takes 7 PCs to describe at least 90% of the original variance.

## Interpreting PCA results

> Q7: What stands out about this plot? Is it easy or difficult to
> understand and why?

``` r
biplot(wisc.pr)
```

![](Class08_Lab_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)

The main thing that stands out about this plot is that all the clusters
are all really close together. This density makes the plot difficult to
understand as it’s hardd to pick out individual clusters.

Our main PCA “score plot” or “PC plot” of results:

``` r
library(ggplot2)
```

``` r
ggplot(wisc.pr$x) +
  aes(PC1,PC2, col=diagnosis) +
  geom_point()
```

![](Class08_Lab_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png)

> Q8: Generate a similar plot for PCs 1 and 3, what do you notice about
> these plots?

``` r
ggplot(wisc.pr$x) +
  aes(PC1, PC3, col=diagnosis) +
  geom_point()
```

![](Class08_Lab_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png)

I noticed that in this plot, PC1 appears to be flipped relative to the
x-plane and is now upside down compared to the first plot. I notice that
in both plots, there’s still a pretty clear distinction between
diagnosis “B” and “M”.

## Communicating PCA results

## Hierarchical Clustering

> Q10: What is the height at which the clustering model has 4 clusters?

``` r
data.scaled <- scale(wisc.data)
```

``` r
data.dist <- dist(data.scaled)
```

``` r
wisc.hclust <- hclust(data.dist, method = "complete")
```

``` r
plot(wisc.hclust)
abline(h = 19, col="red", lty=2)
```

![](Class08_Lab_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png)

The clustering model has 4 clusters at a height of 19.

``` r
wisc.hclust.clusters <- cutree(wisc.hclust,k=4)
```

``` r
table(wisc.hclust.clusters, diagnosis)
```

                        diagnosis
    wisc.hclust.clusters   B   M
                       1  12 165
                       2   2   5
                       3 343  40
                       4   0   2

``` r
table(wisc.hclust.clusters)
```

    wisc.hclust.clusters
      1   2   3   4 
    177   7 383   2 

> Q12: Which method gives your favorite results for the same data.dist
> dataset? Explain your reasoning.

I believe that the `ward.D2` method gives the best results for the same
dataset. The other methods connect clusters based on distance, while
`ward.D2` groups based on minimizing the variance within a cluster. This
helps to dampen some of the noise, which is especially helpful with such
a large dataset.

## Combining Methods

Here we will take our PCA resuluts and use those an input for
clustering. In other words our `wisc.pr$x` scores that we plotted above
(the main output from PCA - how the data lie on our new principal
component axis/variables) and use a subset of the PCs that capture the
most variance as input for `hclust()`.

``` r
pc.dist <- dist(wisc.pr$x[,1:3])
wisc.pr.hclust <- hclust(pc.dist, method = "ward.D2")
plot(wisc.pr.hclust)
```

![](Class08_Lab_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png)

Cut the dendrogram/tree into two main groups/clusters:

``` r
grps <- cutree(wisc.pr.hclust, k=2)
table(grps)
```

    grps
      1   2 
    203 366 

``` r
table(grps, diagnosis)
```

        diagnosis
    grps   B   M
       1  24 179
       2 333  33

I want to know how clustering in `grps` with values of 1 or 2 correspond
to the expert `diagnosis`

``` r
table(grps, diagnosis)
```

        diagnosis
    grps   B   M
       1  24 179
       2 333  33

My clustering **groups 1** are mostly “M” diagnosis (179) and my
clustering **group 2** are mostly “B” diagnosis (333)

> Q13: How well does the newly created `hclust` model with two clusters

It does well, there is a clear majority of either diagnosis between each
cluster with only a small minority of the other diagnosis.

> Q14: How well do the hierarchical clustering models you created in the
> previous sections (i.e. without first doing PCA) do in terms of
> separating the diagnoses?

``` r
table(wisc.hclust.clusters, diagnosis)
```

                        diagnosis
    wisc.hclust.clusters   B   M
                       1  12 165
                       2   2   5
                       3 343  40
                       4   0   2

They do not do as well for separating the diagnoses, there are multiple
clusters instead of 2 clear clusters which have a single diagnosis
dominating them.

Patient 2 should be prioritized for follow up based on the results as
they reflect a malignant diagnosis
